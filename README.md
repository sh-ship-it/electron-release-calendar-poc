# Electron Release Calendar (Proof of Concept)

This is a simple full-stack starter setup for the Electron GSoC project idea: Releases Working Group Calendar Website.

## Structure

- `backend/`: Express.js server fetching Chromium release data.
- `frontend/`: Placeholder for future UI.

## Getting Started

1. `cd backend && npm install express axios`
2. `node index.js` to start backend.
3. Open `frontend/index.html` in a browser for static UI (React to be added).

Future updates will include dynamic calendar UI, admin routes, and bot integration.
